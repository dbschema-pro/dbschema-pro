## DbSchema Overview
**DbSchema Model**: Design your database visually by creating tables, defining foreign keys, adding tags, comments, and more. The model is independent of the database, allowing you to work offline and sync changes later.

**Relational Data Editor**: Explore and edit data from multiple tables simultaneously, even without writing SQL code. Use foreign keys to navigate between related records easily.

**HTML5 Documentation**: Create interactive schema documentation with a vector diagram. Table and column comments appear as tooltips when you hover over them, making it easy to understand the structure and relationships in your database.
